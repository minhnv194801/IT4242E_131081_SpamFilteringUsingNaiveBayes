I try to use and evaluate Naive Bayes algorithm in spam email classification

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balaka18/email-spam-classification-dataset-csv

This project does not use any external libraries, thus can be open and run using any Java IDE (preferably intelliJ).
The results in the report was obtained by running the main method in NaiveBayesEvaluator
